A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon.

Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Broch\u00f3w. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807\u20131855), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811\u20131881) and Emilia (1812\u20131827).

After a further ten seconds it is joined by lower-register guitar drones played by the Edge, and a repetition of four descending piano notes performed by the Edge and Bono. Forty-five seconds into the song, halfway through the introduction, Clayton's bass and percussion by drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. fade into the song with producer Jacknife Lee's synthesizers, which play part of the melody line. The first verse begins at 1:20 and is accompanied by the bass, drums and rhythm guitar playing the chord progression A\u266d\u2013E\u266d\u2013D\u266d. This alters to B\u2013D\u266d in the pre-chorus, with a short harmony vocal line leading to the E\u266d\u2013D\u266d chorus.After the second chorus, the lead guitar alternates with Bono's repeated \"Time\" into the B\u266d\u2013A\u266d bridge before returning to an extended chorus. The vocals range from D\u266d3 in the verses to a peak of C5 in the chorus. The Edge provides backing vocals in the second verse, the first three chorus lines, and the bridge lyric \"Time won't leave me as I am / Time won't take the boy out of this man\". There is no chorus after the third verse; instead, the track enters into a coda where, after restating the introductory piano theme, the guitar, bass, and drum parts come to a finish. The song concludes on a final reprise of the piano notes. The radio edit, with a run-time of 4:11, is 1:36 shorter than the album version. The introduction is half the length and the bass and drums enter after only two repetitions of the piano notes. The first two verses are kept intact but the bridge is shortened by seven seconds, removing two calls of \"Time.\" The third verse is cut and the coda shortened by twenty seconds.The sound of \"City of Blinding Lights\" has been compared to U2's 1987 single \"Where the Streets Have No Name,\" prompted by a similar style of guitar playing, as well as to the atmospheric tone of the band's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire. The melding of guitar and piano in the introduction was likened by the Edmonton Journal to the Coldplay song \"Clocks.\" Rolling Stone described the song as \"building into a bittersweet lament\", while Uncut said it was \"beautiful but slightly sinister\", comparing the quality of the lyrics to the George Harrison song \"The Inner Light.\"", "question": "What is the name of the band whose 1984 album was Unforgettable Fire?", "answers": {"text": ["U2"], "answer_start": [2139]}}, "truncated_cells": []}, {"row_idx": 34, "row": {"id": "bbaae7743346bf9606505d2ac259b3fd0aa6e213", "title": "\"City of Blinding Lights\"", "context": "The underlying theme of \"City of Blinding Lights,\" reflected in the chorus, is lost innocence.

Both songs incorporated electronic elements, yet retained the hard rock elements of the band's previous material; one reviewer called the two singles \"balls-out, full-energy chargers\" and wrote off the Pumpkins' previous remarks that the upcoming album would \"rock\" less. However, the new album material Corgan was writing consisted mainly of simple acoustic songs. Corgan, James Iha, D'arcy Wretzky, and Matt Walker spent a few days in the studio in February 1997 laying down demos mostly as live takes, and the band hoped to quickly record an entire album in such a manner. Corgan, hoping to maintain the band's progressive rock-inspired experimentation, soon had second thoughts about this approach and began envisioning a hybrid of folk rock and electronica that was at once \"ancient\" and \"futuristic\".", "question": "What was the last name of Corgan's best friend?", "answers": {"text": ["Chamberlin"], "answer_start": [605]}}, "truncated_cells": []}, {"row_idx": 62, "row": {"id": "e02c89916621b3233c68e99052ceddc576a87e4b", "title": "The Wood", "context": "Roland is getting married (and is currently missing) and Slim, who scoffs at the idea of marriage, is furious at Roland for disappearing.

In March 1988, it was released as the fourth single from the album in New Zealand and Australia, while \"In God's Country\" was released as the fourth single in North America. The release charted at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart.\nThe track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a M\u0101ori man the band first met in Auckland during the Unforgettable Fire Tour in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer Bono and later served as a roadie for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the tangi funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to \"One Tree Hill\" in Carroll's memory. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the tangi and during his first night in New Zealand when Carroll took him up Auckland's One Tree Hill. They also pay homage to Chilean singer-songwriter and activist V\u00edctor Jara. Musically, the song was developed in a jam session with producer Brian Eno. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.\n\"One Tree Hill\" was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as \"a soft, haunting benediction\", \"a remarkable musical centrepiece\", and a celebration of life. U2 delayed performing the song on the Joshua Tree Tour in 1987 because of Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the Lovetown Tour of 1989\u20131990. It has appeared only sporadically since then, and most renditions were performed in New Zealand. Performances in November 2010 on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour were dedicated to the miners who died in the Pike River Mine disaster.

The release charted at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart.\nThe track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a M\u0101ori man the band first met in Auckland during the Unforgettable Fire Tour in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer Bono and later served as a roadie for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the tangi funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to \"One Tree Hill\" in Carroll's memory. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the tangi and during his first night in New Zealand when Carroll took him up Auckland's One Tree Hill. They also pay homage to Chilean singer-songwriter and activist V\u00edctor Jara. Musically, the song was developed in a jam session with producer Brian Eno. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.\n\"One Tree Hill\" was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as \"a soft, haunting benediction\", \"a remarkable musical centrepiece\", and a celebration of life. U2 delayed performing the song on the Joshua Tree Tour in 1987 because of Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the Lovetown Tour of 1989\u20131990. It has appeared only sporadically since then, and most renditions were performed in New Zealand. Performances in November 2010 on the U2 360\u00b0 Tour were dedicated to the miners who died in the Pike River Mine disaster.

His other outlet is watching people who live a life that he does not know how to make for himself, a life of home and family. John does not know how to act when a female co-worker shows interest in him.  John exhibits all the signs of someone who has suffered untold tragedies in his life.While driving back to town on a dark and isolated road, John comes upon a car stopped up ahead. He immediately sees a hose attached to the exhaust pipe. He has come upon a suicide by carbon monoxide and tries to help, but the woman is already dead.  Suddenly, headlights appear in the opposite direction and John's immediate reaction is to hide the body, though he has done nothing wrong. John is like one who feels blame for every event, even those for which there is no blame. That decision leads John to take the body of the dead young woman to a shed in the woods. Now John finds the intimacy and physical contact he so desperately craves.\nEarly the next morning, John is awakened to hear the sounds of police combing the woods calling his name. He has overslept. He quickly throws on some clothes and begins to run through the woods, but townspeople have now taken up the search for John. He runs at first, but he suddenly gives up trying to escape his pursuers and turns to face them, looking skyward. The townspeople have found him first. He knows his fate, and the townspeople club him before the police arrive.\nIn his final moments, the policewoman who first comes upon John touches his head to examine his wounds and strokes his wounded forehead as he dies from the clubbing.

Recording began at AIR Studios in London in May 1981. At the time, McCartney was recording Tug of War, the former Beatle's first solo album after the breakup of his group Wings.Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, and became friends with both. While at the dining table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. \"This is the way to make big money\", the musician informed Jackson. \"Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid.\" McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of ATV Music Publishing in 1985.\nMcCartney played several instruments on \"Say Say Say\", including percussion, synthesiser, guitar, and bass guitar. The harmonica was played by Chris Smith and the rhythm guitar was played by David Williams. The song was engineered by former Beatles sound engineer, Geoff Emerick. The production of \"Say Say Say\" was completed in February 1983, after it had been refined and overdubbed at Cherokee Studios in California.\nGeorge Martin, who had worked with The Beatles, produced the song. He said of his experience with Jackson, \"He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's no question about it. He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is ... but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas.\"Jackson also spoke of the experience in his autobiography, Moonwalk. The younger singer revealed that the collaboration boosted his confidence, as Quincy Jones\u2014producer of Thriller\u2014was not present to correct his mistakes. Jackson added that he and McCartney worked as equals, stating, \"Paul never had to carry me in that studio.\"According to Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, \"Say Say Say\" was performed in common time, with a dance beat of 116 beats per minute. It is in the key of B\u266d minor and sung in a vocal range from F3 to B\u266d4.

The buying and selling of sheep and wool were no longer centred on the great Abbeys, being handled locally by the new landowners and tenants. This enhanced Keswick's importance as a market centre, though at first the town remained only modestly prosperous: in the 1530s John Leland wrote of it as \"a lytle poore market town\". By the second half of the century copper mining had made Keswick richer: in 1586 William Camden wrote of \"these copper works not only being sufficient for all England, but great quantities of the copper exported every year\" with, at the centre, \"Keswicke, a small market town, many years famous for the copper works as appears from a charter of king Edward IV, and at present inhabited by miners\".Earlier copper mining had been small in scale, but Elizabeth I, concerned for the defence of her kingdom, required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships. There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land. The experts in copper mining were German, and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel Hechstetter of Augsburg, to whom she granted a licence to \"search, dig, try, roast and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold, silver, copper and quicksilver\" in the Keswick area and elsewhere.\nAs well as copper, a new substance was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, and is now known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from the second half of the 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.The copper mines prospered for about seventy years, but by the early 17th century the industry was in decline. Demand for copper fell and the cost of extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the boom of the mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.", "question": "What is the current name of the mineral for which many uses were quickly discovered?

The town is 31.4 miles (50.5 km) south-west of Carlisle, 22.1 miles (35.6 km) northwest of Windermere and 14.2 miles (22.9 km) south-east of Cockermouth. Derwentwater, the lake to the south-west of the town, is approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) long by 1 mile (1.6 km) wide and is some 72 feet (22 m) deep. It contains several islands, including Derwent Isle, Lord's Island, Rampsholme Island and St Herbert's Island, the largest. Derwent Isle is the only island on the lake that is inhabited; it is run by the National Trust and open to visitors five days a year. The land between Keswick and the lake consists mainly of fields and areas of woodland, including Isthmus Wood, Cockshot Wood, Castlehead Wood and Horseclose and Great Wood, further to the south. The River Derwent flows from Derwentwater to Bassenthwaite, the most northerly of the major Cumbrian lakes. The Derwent and its tributary the Greta, which flows through Keswick, meet to the east of Portinscale. The source of the Greta is near Threlkeld, at the confluence of the River Glenderamackin and St John's Beck.Keswick is in the lee of the Skiddaw group, the oldest group of rocks in the Lake District. These fells were formed during the Ordovician period, 488 to 443 million years ago; they form a triangle sheltering the town, reaching a maximum height of 931m on Skiddaw itself. To the west of Portinscale, to the south-west of the village of Thornthwaite, is Whinlatter Forest Park and Grisedale Pike. To the east, beyond Castlerigg stone circle, is St John's in the Vale, at the foot of the Helvellyn range, which is popular with ramblers starting from Keswick. In 2010, Electricity North West, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the conservation charity Friends of the Lake District invested \u00a3100,000 to remove power lines and replace them with underground cables, to improve the quality of scenery in the vicinity.Climatically, Keswick is in the North West sector of the UK, which is characterised by cool summers, mild winters, and high monthly rainfalls throughout the year.

The Alhambra cinema in St John Street, opened in 1913, is one of the oldest continuously functioning cinemas in the country; it is equipped with digital technology and satellite receiving equipment to allow the live screening of plays, operas and ballet from the National Theatre, Royal Opera House and other venues.The town is the site of the Cumberland Pencil Museum. One of the exhibits is what is claimed to be the world's largest coloured pencil. Fitz Park, on the bank of the River Greta, is home to the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery, a Victorian museum which features the Musical Stones of Skiddaw, Southey manuscripts, and a collection of sculptures and paintings of regional and wider importance, including works by Epstein, John Opie, Richard Westall and others. After extensive restoration and enlargement the museum reopened in 2014. In 2001 the cricket ground in Fitz Park was named the most beautiful in England by Wisden Cricket Monthly.Greta Hall (see Lake Poets, below), is a Grade I listed building. The home of Coleridge in 1800\u201304 and Southey from 1803 until 1843, it later became part of Keswick School and is now in private ownership, partly divided into holiday flats.

At the time, McCartney was recording Tug of War, the former Beatle's first solo album after the breakup of his group Wings.Jackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, and became friends with both. While at the dining table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. \"This is the way to make big money\", the musician informed Jackson. \"Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid.\" McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of ATV Music Publishing in 1985.\nMcCartney played several instruments on \"Say Say Say\", including percussion, synthesiser, guitar, and bass guitar. The harmonica was played by Chris Smith and the rhythm guitar was played by David Williams. The song was engineered by former Beatles sound engineer, Geoff Emerick. The production of \"Say Say Say\" was completed in February 1983, after it had been refined and overdubbed at Cherokee Studios in California.\nGeorge Martin, who had worked with The Beatles, produced the song. He said of his experience with Jackson, \"He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's no question about it. He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is ... but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas.\"Jackson also spoke of the experience in his autobiography, Moonwalk. The younger singer revealed that the collaboration boosted his confidence, as Quincy Jones\u2014producer of Thriller\u2014was not present to correct his mistakes. Jackson added that he and McCartney worked as equals, stating, \"Paul never had to carry me in that studio.\"According to Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, \"Say Say Say\" was performed in common time, with a dance beat of 116 beats per minute. It is in the key of B\u266d minor and sung in a vocal range from F3 to B\u266d4.

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"Chopin was born Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including Robert Schumann). In 1835, Chopin obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of pericarditis aggravated by tuberculosis.\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some 19 songs set to Polish lyrics. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, \u00e9tudes, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J.S. Bach, Mozart, and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest.

A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of pericarditis aggravated by tuberculosis.\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some 19 songs set to Polish lyrics. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, \u00e9tudes, impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J.S. Bach, Mozart, and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying historical fidelity.", "question": "What is the full name of the person that was admired by Robert Schumann?", "answers": {"text": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fran\u00e7ois Chopin"], "answer_start": [0]}}, "truncated_cells": []}, {"row_idx": 20, "row": {"id": "93abf5f0d4bae666a4f60f984ca1ddebec92625d", "title": "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin", "context": "Fryderyk Chopin was born in \u017belazowa Wola, 46 kilometres (29 miles) west of Warsaw, in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish state established by Napoleon.

Nicolas tutored children of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Tekla Justyna Krzy\u017canowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Broch\u00f3w. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807\u20131855), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811\u20131881) and Emilia (1812\u20131827). Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted on the use of the Polish language in the household.In October 1810, six months after Fryderyk's birth, the family moved to Warsaw, where his father acquired a post teaching French at the Warsaw Lyceum, then housed in the Saxon Palace. Fryderyk lived with his family in the Palace grounds.  The father played the flute and violin; the mother played the piano and gave lessons to boys in the boarding house that the Chopins kept.

During its 27-year lifespan, the reactor operated for the equivalent of 140 days, running for some days at half power and for as little as 10 minutes.The More Hall Annex was a two-story, reinforced concrete structure designed in the Brutalist style, similar to other buildings on the university campus built during the post-war era. It occupied a footprint of 69 ft 8 in (21.23 m) from north to south and 76 ft (23 m) from east to west, with a total of 7,595 square feet (705.6 m2) of interior space. The building was designed by a consortium of UW faculty members, known as The Architect Artist Group (TAAG), with input from nuclear engineering department chair Albert L. Babb. Babb requested a building that would \"show the world what nuclear power looked like\", desiring a prominent structure on the campus that would serve as a crown jewel for the department. The large glass walls enabled public viewing of the reactor room's interior, showcasing the activity inside.The first floor, partly covered by the outdoor plaza, housed the reactor, laboratory, crystal spectrometer, counting room with a nuclear densometer, classrooms, restrooms, and offices. The second floor contained the control room, an observatory, and a lecture room overlooking the reactor; it was open to the outdoor plaza on three sides, with large glass windows allowing for public observation of experiments. The reactor was placed on the lower side of the building, downhill of the plaza, to allow the ground to absorb accidental radiation leaks. The structure's roof rested on a series of perpendicular beams that also supported a three-ton (2,700 kg) crane used to lift the reactor shield between experiments.", "question": "What was described as a building that would \"show the world what nuclear power looked like\"?", "answers": {"text": ["The More Hall Annex"], "answer_start": [473]}}, "truncated_cells": []}, {"row_idx": 52, "row": {"id": "5d98f14bb75380ba1586a2f65b8c923f92282ebd", "title": "Margaret Murray", "context": "Margaret Murray was born on 13 July 1863 in Calcutta, Bengal Presidency, then a major military city in British India.

Historians of Early Modern Britain like George Norman Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work, although the latter subsequently distanced himself from the theory. For the 1961 reprint of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, the Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's \"minor details may be open to criticism\", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by Arno Runeberg in his 1947 book Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic as well as Pennethorne Hughes in his 1952 book Witches. As a result, the Canadian historian Elliot Rose, writing in 1962, claimed that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials \"seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels\", being widely accepted among \"educated people\".Rose suggested that the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \"imposing credentials\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\".

In March 1988, it was released as the fourth single from the album in New Zealand and Australia, while \"In God's Country\" was released as the fourth single in North America. The release charted at number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart.\nThe track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a M\u0101ori man the band first met in Auckland during the Unforgettable Fire Tour in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer Bono and later served as a roadie for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the tangi funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to \"One Tree Hill\" in Carroll's memory. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the tangi and during his first night in New Zealand when Carroll took him up Auckland's One Tree Hill. They also pay homage to Chilean singer-songwriter and activist V\u00edctor Jara. Musically, the song was developed in a jam session with producer Brian Eno. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.\n\"One Tree Hill\" was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as \"a soft, haunting benediction\", \"a remarkable musical centrepiece\", and a celebration of life. U2 delayed performing the song on the Joshua Tree Tour in 1987 because of Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the Lovetown Tour of 1989\u20131990.
