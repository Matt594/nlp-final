It used uranium-235 as fuel and was cooled by water. The reactor's chamber, placed on the lower floor of the facility, was 15 ft (4.6 m) high, 20 ft (6.1 m) long, and 19 ft (5.8 m) wide. During its 27-year lifespan, the reactor operated for the equivalent of 140 days, running for some days at half power and for as little as 10 minutes.The More Hall Annex was a two-story, reinforced concrete structure designed in the Brutalist style, similar to other buildings on the university campus built during the post-war era. It occupied a footprint of 69 ft 8 in (21.23 m) from north to south and 76 ft (23 m) from east to west, with a total of 7,595 square feet (705.6 m2) of interior space. The building was designed by a consortium of UW faculty members, known as The Architect Artist Group (TAAG), with input from nuclear engineering department chair Albert L. Babb. Babb requested a building that would \"show the world what nuclear power looked like\", desiring a prominent structure on the campus that would serve as a crown jewel for the department. The large glass walls enabled public viewing of the reactor room's interior, showcasing the activity inside.The first floor, partly covered by the outdoor plaza, housed the reactor, laboratory, crystal spectrometer, counting room with a nuclear densometer, classrooms, restrooms, and offices. The second floor contained the control room, an observatory, and a lecture room overlooking the reactor; it was open to the outdoor plaza on three sides, with large glass windows allowing for public observation of experiments. The reactor was placed on the lower side of the building, downhill of the plaza, to allow the ground to absorb accidental radiation leaks. The structure's roof rested on a series of perpendicular beams that also supported a three-ton (2,700 kg) crane used to lift the reactor shield between experiments.", "context_id": "9bfa99894600f2c5550ceddd956d4afbcabbbb2b"}]}, {"title": "Bridge to the Sun", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_to_the_Sun", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What are the first names of the bride and groom?", "id": "8f2f1e9bfd200507f180496422f7d90097818079", "answers": [{"text": "Gwen", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Hidenari", "answer_start": 53}], "original_id": "b23c73ebd89161df0a3c45bb16a3ad1f8085a04a"}], "context": "Gwen Harold, an American woman from Tennessee, meets Hidenari Terasaki (called Terry by his friends and family), the secretary to the Japanese Ambassador, while attending a reception at the Japanese Embassy in Washington D.C. with her Aunt Peggy and friend Bill.  They share a moment while Terry is showing her the antique Japanese artworks on display in the Embassy, and after some reluctance, she agrees to allow him to call on her.\nThey begin dating and they quickly fall in love, even though Terry occasionally has fits of anti-western sentiment.  When Terry asks her to marry him, she agrees, much to the chagrin of Aunt Peggy (who was raised in the Jim Crow South), and who sees the relationship as unnatural, especially when there are \"nice clean young men\" available.  The Japanese Ambassador also calls on Gwen and attempts to dissuade her from accepting, claiming it would hurt Terry's career by giving him an American bias, and states that even though the two countries are friendly, anything could happen between foreign countries.  He seems to hint at possible aggression in the future, even though it is only 1935 and the Japanese have not yet resumed conflicts with China, keeping the countries of Gwen and Terry at an uneasy peace. They eventually marry despite the obstacles and, when Terry is recalled, travel to Japan by ship.\nAlmost immediately after disembarking and arriving in Tokyo, Terry begins to treat Gwen much differently, expecting her to behave according to the male-centric beliefs of contemporary Japan, such as being silent among men, always entering doors after the men, and virtually bending to every whim of Terry and her male relatives.  They continually fight and make up, mostly because of Gwen's outspokenness among men and Terry's strict adherence to the local customs.", "context_id": "04039058b4c6499becccc0e12c026e3b3b10ee9f"}]}, {"title": "All Neat in Black Stockings", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Neat_in_Black_Stockings", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the name of the person who buys Jill a stuffed animal?", "id": "bfdf9b688c76154087764e016243c48882e95187", "answers": [{"text": "Ginger", "answer_start": 0}], "original_id": "d83c201618212727f8a3519fbfa7e93d8ebb9d21"}, {"question": "Who does the window washer buy a stuffed animal for?", "id": "bea29f03af0d9ab902c9c41f655407c91c3b406b", "answers": [{"text": "Jill", "answer_start": 387}], "original_id": "d83c201618212727f8a3519fbfa7e93d8ebb9d21"}], "context": "Ginger is a window washer with an eye for the girls.

Chris and his fellow agents infiltrate a mansion in Mexico, to rescue their missing undercover source, Cathy White. Inside the mansion, Chris's fellow agents are ambushed by zombies and death traps, with Chris being the sole survivor and barely making it out alive. Chris then comes face-to-face with Arias outside the mansion and is defeated by him in close quarters combat . He then finds out that Cathy has become a zombie under Arias's control. Arias had previously become a vampire and figured out how to turn people into zombies. As Arias leaves with his associates, Maria and Diego Gomez, the BSAA rescues Chris by slaughtering Cathy and the remaining zombie horde.

Feeling the limitations of their guitar-driven hard rock sound, the band had started to branch out during the making of Mellon Collie, and, after the chart-topping success of the electronic-leaning \"1979\", the band zeroed in on electronica.\nAs the sprawling and massively successful Infinite Sadness tour wound down, Billy Corgan, the leader of th band, found himself facing many difficult issues, including musical burnout, the absence of his \"best friend and musical soul mate in the band\" Jimmy Chamberlin, the end of his marriage, and the death of his mother to cancer.During this period, the band released two new singles on movie soundtracks\u2014\"Eye\" and \"The End Is the Beginning Is the End\". Both songs incorporated electronic elements, yet retained the hard rock elements of the band's previous material; one reviewer called the two singles \"balls-out, full-energy chargers\" and wrote off the Pumpkins' previous remarks that the upcoming album would \"rock\" less. However, the new album material Corgan was writing consisted mainly of simple acoustic songs. Guitarist James Iha, vocalist D'arcy Wretzky, and James' best friend Matt Walker spent a few days in the studio in February 1997 laying down demos mostly as live takes, and the band hoped to quickly record an entire album in such a manner. Corgan, hoping to maintain the band's progressive rock-inspired experimentation, soon had second thoughts about this approach and began envisioning a hybrid of folk rock and electronica that was at once \"ancient\" and \"futuristic\".", "context_id": "f8d7ff8ad8120372f2e219034e95b9bc8f7dd132"}]}, {"title": "Journey to Promethea", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_Promethea", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "Who is told that the chosen boy will possess \"the light\" of Draden in his eyes?", "id": "5b5fdadb0f1239d6f539a887881d76f4c5fc006b", "answers": [{"text": "King Laypach", "answer_start": 135}], "original_id": "7d9d712ea4c4df8ed10783b2588f11ca34804a63"}, {"question": "Whose prophecy says that the chosen boy will possess \"the light\" of Draden in his eyes?", "id": "1fb199fb93c59b551a8bd7e866e81f6e1bec2afc", "answers": [{"text": "Draden", "answer_start": 309}], "original_id": "7d9d712ea4c4df8ed10783b2588f11ca34804a63"}], "context": "The movie opens with a narration describing the fate of the Samillian Tribe; once a noble people, they were subjugated by the despotic King Laypach and condemned to wander aimlessly in the wilderness.

His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty, and he followed the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear compositional structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals.Hu's work was known outside his local area.  Zhou Lianggong, a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur, stated in his Biography of Seal-Carvers (Yinren Zhuan, \u5370\u4eba\u50b3) that Hu \"creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure\", implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing.In 1644, Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the Hongguang Emperor, which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer. He presented his creation with an essay, the Great Exhortation of the Seal (Dabao Zhen, \u5927\u5bf6\u7bb4), in which he bemoaned the loss of the Chongzhen Emperor's seal and begged Heaven's favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally-footed couplets (pianti, \u99e2\u9ad4) used in the Imperial examinations, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court.", "context_id": "8ee6ed691a09539c91f2dea8c47955c7feade63f"}]}, {"title": "Smart Girls Don't Talk", "url":

She was a pupil and later associate of the composer Gustav Holst, and was instrumental in the organisation and management of various of the music festivals which Holst sponsored. Many of her works were composed for performance at these festivals and similar occasions. Her early death at age 35, which prevented the full realisation of her talents, was considered by her contemporaries as a considerable loss to English music.\nHolst first observed Joseph's potential when he was teaching her composition at St Paul's Girls' School. She began to act as his amanuensis in 1914, when he was composing The Planets, her special responsibility being the preparation of the score for the \"Neptune\" movement. She continued to assist Holst with transcriptions, arrangements and translations, and was his librettist for the choral ballet The Golden Goose.\nDuring her short professional life she became an active member of the Society of Women Musicians, was the prime mover behind the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and helped to found the Kensington Choral Society.  She also taught music at a girls' school, where Holst's daughter Imogen was one of her pupils, and became a leading figure in the musical life of Morley College. Two memorial prizes and scholarships were endowed in her name.\nMost of Joseph's compositions were never published and are now considered lost. Of her published works, two early short orchestral pieces, Morris Dance and Bergamask won considerable critical praise, although neither became part of the general orchestral repertory.  Two choral works, A Festival Venite and A Hymn for Whitsuntide were admired during her lifetime, but never commercially recorded. Since her death, her work has seldom been performed, but occasionally been broadcast.  Her carol \"A Little Childe There is Ibore\" was thought by Holst to be among the best of its kind.", "context_id": "5f34135887ffdbbb737d30c8bc6fd07aeaae803d"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the full name of the high mistress of SPGS?", "id": "bfc96ebdfbc3db0ef717dc42affa53afd72d9918", "answers": [{"text": "Frances Ralph Gray", "answer_start": 199}], "original_id": "dc19699c5d7d70e35d89ab9c83bb937416a567c1"}, {"question": "What is the name of the Joseph's first published work?", "id": "d00b7c7da40dae4a58c6135863b9f3469ec4a40b", "answers": [{"text": "\"The Carrion Crow\"", "answer_start": 629}], "original_id": "cb5447eabba857aefd43f975418694ff2b45befc"}, {"question": "On what topics did Joseph present papers at the the school's Literary Society?", "id": "0b3160146ba695c1bb853c7ba0c3cbc2d5fa08ab", "answers": [{"text": "Charlotte Bront\u00eb", "answer_start": 802}, {"text": "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", "answer_start": 823}], "original_id": "eee573a81ee85674381511f1e525ab1e5fe03e0a"}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who learnt composition from Gustav Holst?", "id": "d5644d077ecf6185972de596419910d492ae9669", "answers": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 8}], "original_id": "96e3c4b500f4c9e28facac8dadb493399fb9a7fd"}, {"question": "What are the names of schools where Holst who was a music teacher, initially at the ?

The school had opened in 1904, as an offshoot of the long-established St Paul's School for boys. Its high mistress, Frances Ralph Gray, was a formidable figure with traditional views about female education, who nevertheless provided a lively and varied learning environment in which Joseph excelled.  Apart from her academic successes, Joseph played double-bass in the school orchestra, gave an acclaimed piano performance of Bach's D minor keyboard concerto, began to compose, and won a prize for sight-reading. While at the school she composed \"The Carrion Crow\", a song setting which, in 1914, became her first published work. Outside music she supported the school's Literary Society, where she presented papers on Charlotte Bront\u00eb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. She also won Honours in the examinations of the Royal Drawing Society.\nAmong the music teachers at SPGS, most significantly in terms of her musical development, Joseph encountered the emergent composer Gustav Holst, then little known, who taught her composition. After leaving the Royal College of Music in 1898 Holst had earned his living as an organist, and as a trombonist in various orchestras, while awaiting critical recognition as a composer. In 1903 he gave up his orchestral appointments to concentrate on composing, but found that he needed a regular income. He became a music teacher, initially at the James Allen's Girls' School in Dulwich; in 1905 he was recommended to Frances Gray by Adine O'Neill, a former pupil of Clara Schumann, who taught piano at SPGS. He was first appointed on a part-time basis to teach singing, and later extended his activities to cover the school's wider music curriculum including conducting and composition. According to the composer Alan Gibbs, Joseph quickly came under Holst's spell, and adopted his principles as her own. Holst later described her as the best girl pupil he ever had: \"From the first she showed an individual attitude of mind and an eagerness to absorb all that was beautiful\".", "context_id": "53e8d378c7414e53d10d3126ef7e6d66c0a01b77"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the name of the school Holst's daughter's attended?", "id": "3521243b16d7eb7b12371dc70ea9474942f3cce1", "answers": [{"text": "Eothen", "answer_start": 315}], "original_id": "9ff2bfda93ac7a624af00d4bb9d0ed81d71e073a"}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who was possibly taught by Adolph Borsdorf?", "id": "8906ff38e82d8f727b522fbebe8388483e529f5d", "answers": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 5}], "original_id": "ab9a4049f2c71c4903ed9d4ca03d6b13409c2e01"}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who was member of the Morley committee?", "id": "63f64f130740c6a05d72f7f5f1d495683acdbcf0", "answers": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 5}], "original_id": "5be148f9e8f35994da58b7871e767d2ccc70f162"}, {"question": "What is the name of the opera that was inspired by English Opera as She is Wrote?", "id": "98857cfeedd41a5194b6db4828aadbd382acbb96", "answers": [{"text": "The Perfect Fool", "answer_start": 1330}], "original_id": "2656747dbdc131ddb4c8bd6d6403e7dd1cd186f9"}], "context": "When Joseph left Girton, the First World War was at a critical state; the Battle of the Somme had begun on 1 July 1916. Joseph wanted to assist the war effort, and after considering work on the land or in a munitions factory, took up part-time welfare work in Islington. In the autumn of 1916 she began teaching at Eothen, a small private school for girls in Caterham, founded and run by the Misses Catharine and Winifred Pye. In 1917 Holst's ten-year-old daughter Imogen started at the school; soon, under Joseph's guidance the young pupil was composing her own music. Joseph extended her own musical activities by joining the orchestra at Morley College, where Holst was the director of music and where her brother Edwin had played the cello before the war. At first she played the double-bass, but later took French horn lessons, possibly from Adolph Borsdorf; later still, at very short notice, she taught herself the timpani part for a summer concert. By 1918 she was a member of the Morley committee that on 9 March organised and produced an opera burlesque, English Opera as She is Wrote, in which English, Italian, German, French and Russian opera styles were parodied in successive scenes. The performance was a great success and was repeated at several venues. It may have inspired Holst to use parody in his own opera, The Perfect Fool, which he began composing in 1918. In her spare time Joseph founded and ran a choir for Kensington nannies, which took part in local singing contests as the \"Linden Singers\".", "context_id": "bcfb67f80182a4acaf06d9337288ae2c30fc75d6"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where was Jospeh invited for the private premiere of The Planets?", "id": "93b9d8bd4bb4892357de05fb91d45b217690f936", "answers": [{"text": "Queen's Hall", "answer_start": 260}], "original_id": "f37de64a8f866771b0910d3e32791f0c87294503"}, {"question": "Which work by Joseph was showcased at Whitsun musical festival, 1917?", "id": "c7c4e57eab5776edb035a17def58226ba323caa7", "answers": [{"text": "Sing Aloud with Gladness", "answer_start": 974}], "original_id": "2b9a0c69dd0bb84b0b9677ca68e2fcacef760c9a"}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who translated the  apocryphal work The Acts of John from the original Greek?", "id": "176d4ca2e5894831080cc94ba8a811c781723227", "answers": [{"text": "Joseph", "answer_start": 0}], "original_id": "a498c911d56182e06246a933df8fe0fee0b69123"}], "context": "Joseph increased her teaching commitments by often deputising for Holst, both at James Allen's and at SPGS. She also continued in her role of the composer's amanuensis, and was invited to attend the private premiere of The Planets, on 29 September 1918 at the Queen's Hall, where Adrian Boult conducted the Queen's Hall orchestra. She later wrote: \"From the moment of Mars ... to the last sound of Neptune, it was a big thing that will last all our lives, I think\". She was able to draw on her classical education at Girton when she helped to translate the  apocryphal work The Acts of John from the original Greek, to provide the text for Holst's Hymn of Jesus (1917); for the same work she prepared a vocal score and an arrangement for piano, strings and organ. She and Holst combined to produce a women's voices version (two sopranos and an alto) of William Byrd's Mass for Three Voices, and Joseph worked alone to produce an orchestral accompaniment for Samuel Wesley's Sing Aloud with Gladness. This latter work was prepared for the 1917 Whitsun musical festival, one of an annual series of such festivals that Holst masterminded, first at his home town of Thaxted, in later years at assorted venues including Dulwich, Chichester and Canterbury. Joseph became a key figure in these festivals, as organiser, performer and composer. At Thaxted in 1918 two of her compositions were performed: Hymn for female voices (now lost), and an orchestral piece, Barbara Noel's Morris, which Joseph wrote to mark her friendship with the daughter of Conrad Noel, Thaxted's vicar.The years 1917 and 1918 also brought personal sadness. On 22 October 1917 Joseph's father died from a heart attack. On 27 May the following year, just after the Whitsun festival, her brother William was killed in action on the western front; in September, Edwin was severely wounded in the final Allied offensive of the war. In his monograph on Joseph's life and music, the composer Alan Gibbs writes that \"there is no hint in Jane's letters of the effect these events had on her\". Gibbs quotes Duff Cooper, who wrote of those times: \"... if we wept\u2014as weep we did\u2014we wept in secret\".", "context_id": "7f692e20d432f9577fae00f59ff0b749f819c800"}]}, {"title": "Ayumi Hamasaki", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayumi_Hamasaki", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What was the name of the single that debuted along with the album that came on top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks?", "id": "ee106514d3a0914aa7911fa586c07281cb6eeba0", "answers": [{"text": "\"Poker Face\"", "answer_start": 495}], "original_id": "692cd34c4d661666bda8bbce156d110f0bff02db"}, {"question": "Under whose debut tutelage the single \"Poker Face\" was released in 1998?", "id": "30fd8cc22f681602bcf257cfb575690f1fee4cc4", "answers": [{"text": "Max Matsuura", "answer_start": 446}], "original_id": "a9c92726a255e36793d4cc7530364eb4a51f989a"}], "context": "Ayumi Hamasaki (\u6d5c\u5d0e\u3042\u3086\u307f, Hamasaki Ayumi, born October 2, 1978) is a Japanese singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, model, spokesperson and entrepreneur.

The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks, selling over a million copies. Her next ten albums shipped over a million copies in Japan, with her third, Duty, selling nearly three million. A Best, her first compilation album, is her best-selling album, with more than four million copies sold in Japan. Since 2006, after her album Secret was released, album and single sales have declined.Hamasaki has sold over 50 million records, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist of all time. Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (twenty-five), and the most million-sellers. From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the charts.

A member of the wealthy British imperial elite, she lived in the city with her family: parents James and Margaret Murray, an older sister named Mary, and her paternal grandmother and great-grandmother. James Murray, born in India of English descent, was a businessman and manager of the Serampore paper mills who was thrice elected President of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce. His wife, Margaret (n\u00e9e Carr), had moved to India from Britain in 1857 to work as a missionary, preaching Christianity and educating Indian women. She continued with this work after marrying James and giving birth to her two daughters.\nAlthough most of their lives were spent in the European area of Calcutta, which was walled off from the indigenous sectors of the city, Murray encountered members of indigenous society through her family's employment of 10 Indian servants and through childhood holidays to Mussoorie. The historian Amara Thornton has suggested that Murray's Indian childhood continued to exert an influence over her throughout her life, expressing the view that Murray could be seen as having a hybrid transnational identity that was both British and Indian. During her childhood, Murray never received a formal education, and in later life expressed pride in the fact that she had never had to sit an exam before entering university.In 1870, Margaret and her sister Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire. Although John provided them with a strongly Christian education and a belief in the inferiority of women, both of which she would reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany, where they both became fluent in German. In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there till 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in Sydenham, South London. There, they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace, while their father worked at his firm's London office. In 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained for the next seven years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospital's attempts to deal with a cholera outbreak. In 1887, she returned to England, moving to Rugby, Warwickshire, where her uncle John had moved, now widowed. Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired and moved to England, she moved into his house in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she then travelled to Madras, Tamil Nadu, where her sister had moved to with her new husband.", "context_id": "c8f7ee6c8a06a9e0d789498478727de18e5fe478"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the name of the courses Murray took courses at UCL?", "id": "ee4256cae2f39c1ed5a4af4943f05ca554ad5fea", "answers": [{"text": "Ancient Egyptian", "answer_start": 604}, {"text": "Coptic languages", "answer_start": 625}], "original_id": "b978ce3e4c1c5f335684b362b7c138e30085970f"}, {"question": "What is the full name of the person for whom Murray produced the drawings for his published report?", "id": "e9f1a7921f8d4b0c4b69ce3ac4d4e8e05f9ac826", "answers": [{"text": "William Flinders Petrie", "answer_start": 364}], "original_id": "ebdcc46458cbf6a7e47c7bf6daec7b5a23870ecf"}, {"question": "On which position did Murray start teaching at UCL?", "id": "8b0adc9a7e52633d46c0b35bd2b4aa4c428d50d7", "answers": [{"text": "Junior Lecturer", "answer_start": 1286}], "original_id": "90858252cf30fc2fd8d40363aedb429381240fd1"}, {"question": "Who was the fist female lecturer in archeology in the United Kingdom?", "id": "eae032de589442664432fb7c093bdd1cf078ea00", "answers": [{"text": "Murray", "answer_start": 37}], "original_id": "80287fbc9b5478ba6fb9fe90cc1d40db0068cf6c"}, {"question": "What are the names of influential students of Murray?", "id": "05e6d93618577055199fbaa7e3689e8300a919ec", "answers": [{"text": "Reginald Engelbach", "answer_start": 1808}, {"text": "Georgina Aitken", "answer_start": 1828}, {"text": "Guy Brunton", "answer_start": 1845}, {"text": "Myrtle Broome", "answer_start": 1862}], "original_id": "3b386cd48dcdda036197b1baab534fdcaf8c25cc"}, {"question": "Which courses did Murray teach at UCL?", "id": "c450a959d3379ce99a1ab87335dc9bf58235ed1c", "answers": [{"text": "Ancient Egyptian history", "answer_start": 1614}, {"text": "religion", "answer_start": 1640}, {"text": "language", "answer_start": 632}], "original_id": "f60e2cb225eeafbe64304e0d4efb6038357614bf"}, {"question": "In which department did Murray work at UCL?", "id": "60e735faf5c6e54b93ffcf37cefee65f88150910", "answers": [{"text": "Egyptology", "answer_start": 96}], "original_id": "35d946e29bf6a1cfad461f8b6d79020b421e2d2c"}], "context": "Encouraged by her mother and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened department of Egyptology at University College London (UCL) in Bloomsbury, Central London. Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, as part of a class composed largely of other women and older men. There, she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively.Murray soon got to know Petrie, becoming his copyist and illustrator and producing the drawings for the published report on his excavations at Qift, Koptos. In turn, he aided and encouraged her to write her first research paper, \"The Descent of Property in the Early Periods of Egyptian History\", which was published in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology in 1895. Becoming Petrie's de facto though unofficial assistant, Murray began to give some of the linguistic lessons in Griffith's absence. In 1898 she was appointed to the position of Junior Lecturer, responsible for teaching the linguistic courses at the Egyptology department; this made her the first female lecturer in archaeology in the United Kingdom. In this capacity, she spent two days a week at UCL, devoting the other days to caring for her ailing mother. As time went on, she came to teach courses on Ancient Egyptian history, religion, and language. Among Murray's students \u2013 to whom she referred as \"the Gang\" \u2013 were several who went on to produce noted contributions to Egyptology, including Reginald Engelbach, Georgina Aitken, Guy Brunton, and Myrtle Broome.

Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar \u00c9mile Am\u00e9lineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues with some of the male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.During the 1903\u201304 field season, Murray returned to Egypt, and at Petrie's instruction began her investigations at the Saqqara cemetery near to Cairo, which dated from the period of the Old Kingdom. Murray did not have legal permission to excavate the site, and instead spent her time transcribing the inscriptions from ten of the tombs that had been excavated during the 1860s by Auguste Mariette. She published her findings in 1905 as Saqqara Mastabas I, although would not publish translations of the inscriptions until 1937 as Saqqara Mastabas II. Both The Osireion at Abydos and Saqqara Mastabas I proved to be very influential in the Egyptological community, with Petrie recognising Murray's contribution to his own career.", "context_id": "05e4139cb89e425cda6d06fd823ec8ab7a8ceb70"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the name of the person who invitd Murray to lead excavations on Menorca?", "id": "9649324c403243f26a664469fa9c11703f0857fe", "answers": [{"text": "Louis C.

In 1917, she published a paper in Folklore, the journal of the Folklore Society, in which she first articulated her version of the witch-cult theory, arguing that the witches persecuted in European history were actually followers of \"a definite religion with beliefs, ritual, and organization as highly developed as that of any cult in the end\". She followed this up with papers on the subject in the journals Man and the Scottish Historical Review. She articulated these views more fully in her 1921 book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, published by Oxford University Press after receiving a positive peer review by Henry Balfour, and which received both criticism and support on publication. Many reviews in academic journals were critical, with historians claiming that she had distorted and misinterpreted the contemporary records that she was using, but the book was nevertheless influential.\nOn the basis of her work in Malta, Louis C. G. Clarke, the curator of the Cambridge Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, invited her to lead excavations on the island of Menorca from 1930 to 1931. With the aid of Guest, she excavated the talaiotic sites of Trepuc\u00f3 and Sa Torreta de Tramuntana, resulting in the publication of Cambridge Excavations in Minorca. Murray also continued to publish works on Egyptology for a general audience, such as Egyptian Sculpture (1930) and Egyptian Temples (1931), which received largely positive reviews. In the summer of 1925 she led a team of volunteers to excavate Homestead Moat in Whomerle Wood near to Stevenage, Hertfordshire; she did not publish an excavation report and did not mention the event in her autobiography, with her motives for carrying out the excavation remaining unclear.In 1924, UCL promoted Murray to the position of assistant professor, and in 1927 she was awarded an honorary doctorate for her career in Egyptology. That year, Murray was tasked with guiding Mary of Teck, the Queen consort, around the Egyptology department during the latter's visit to UCL. The pressures of teaching had eased by this point, allowing Murray to spend more time travelling internationally; in 1920 she returned to Egypt and in 1929 visited South Africa, where she attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, whose theme was the prehistory of southern Africa. In the early 1930s she travelled to the Soviet Union, where she visited museums in Leningrad, Moscow, Kharkiv, and Kiev, and then in late 1935 she undertook a lecture tour of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Estonia.", "context_id": "7ced3265426be6106dda189e2c1e26ea9a766337"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who incorporated Murray's theories into their work?", "id": "b19f4db0e0b3fad5b493b0feb74b7688eaf83fb8", "answers": [{"text": "Norman Clark", "answer_start": 225}, {"text": "Christopher Hill", "answer_start": 242}], "original_id": "a9258cee1bab212ee3a3a03bdbad49c68c7e955d"}, {"question": "Who distanced himself from Murray's theories?", "id": "e88ecb0016bdeb0f0762c1318959ffc27ae15cfd", "answers": [{"text": "Christopher Hill", "answer_start": 242}], "original_id": "b1c0e66520ff31cf2a25668cf7548378c2fa6482"}, {"question": "What is the name of the person who said Murray's \"minor details may be open to criticism\"?", "id": "c88e806f6709043f4f0707f67de481bc43683358", "answers": [{"text": "Steven Runciman", "answer_start": 451}], "original_id": "4915f39a02e9e6bf26fb91a210dfb5ff05265b6b"}, {"question": "Who recapitulated Murray's tehories in 1952 book Witches?", "id": "c261795d10017005e0f4018155bd6761aee4534a", "answers": [{"text": "Pennethorne Hughes", "answer_start": 741}], "original_id": "395a334efe2611e1d9834e4b66cc49297c50b249"}, {"question": "What is the last name of the person whose theories \"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age?\"", "id": "e2bd1982402c5e58acc296bcf475d4a20db35ab4", "answers": [{"text": "Murray", "answer_start": 26}], "original_id": "6ab2a474f63e4ac1cfbead248644465723b27138"}, {"question": "Who said that Murray's theories confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\"?", "id": "65847d390d4b712246a9d67796585e18c20f2001", "answers": [{"text": "Elliot Rose", "answer_start": 822}], "original_id": "2bb8a12700dffc5d36f076052bd4b7f285f3877b"}], "context": "Upon initial publication, Murray's thesis gained a favourable reception from many readers, including some significant scholars, albeit none who were experts in the witch trials. Historians of Early Modern Britain like George Norman Clark and Christopher Hill incorporated her theories into their work, although the latter subsequently distanced himself from the theory. For the 1961 reprint of The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, the Medieval historian Steven Runciman provided a foreword in which he accepted that some of Murray's \"minor details may be open to criticism\", but in which he was otherwise supportive of her thesis. Her theories were recapitulated by Arno Runeberg in his 1947 book Witches, Demons and Fertility Magic as well as Pennethorne Hughes in his 1952 book Witches. As a result, the Canadian historian Elliot Rose, writing in 1962, claimed that the Murrayite interpretations of the witch trials \"seem to hold, at the time of writing, an almost undisputed sway at the higher intellectual levels\", being widely accepted among \"educated people\".Rose suggested that the reason that Murray's theory gained such support was partly because of her \"imposing credentials\" as a member of staff at UCL, a position that lent her theory greater legitimacy in the eyes of many readers. He further suggested that the Murrayite view was attractive to many as it confirmed \"the general picture of pre-Christian Europe a reader of Frazer or [Robert] Graves would be familiar with\". Similarly, Hutton suggested that the cause of the Murrayite theory's popularity was because it \"appealed to so many of the emotional impulses of the age\", including \"the notion of the English countryside as a timeless place full of ancient secrets\", the literary popularity of Pan, the widespread belief that the majority of British had remained pagan long after the process of Christianisation, and the idea that folk customs represented pagan survivals. At the same time, Hutton suggested, it seemed more plausible to many than the previously dominant rationalist idea that the witch trials were the result of mass delusion. Related to this, the folklorist Jacqueline Simpson suggested that part of the Murrayite theory's appeal was that it appeared to give a \"sensible, demystifying, liberating approach to a longstanding but sterile argument\" between the rationalists who denied that there had been any witches and those, like Montague Summers, who insisted that there had been a real Satanic conspiracy against Christendom in the Early Modern period replete with witches with supernatural powers. \"How refreshing\", noted the historian Hilda Ellis Davidson, \"and exciting her first book was at that period. A new approach, and such a surprising one.\"", "context_id": "4b7f99148e7c19075b58506e3658ed66c7ad94f0"}]}]}
